Michi-c2 --- Michi clone in C (Go gtp engine) 
=============================================

This is a recoding in C (for speed) of the michi.py code by Petr Baudis avalaible at https://github.com/pasky/michi.

A port in C of the original michi has been kept without change at https://github.com/db3108/michi-c with the goal to retain the brevity, clarity and simplicity of the original code.

Please go on the above projects pages to read more about Michi and to find some information about theory or interesting projects to do.

Usage 
-----

See the user manual by opening *doc/manual.html* in any web browser.
If you are browsing the code on GitHub you can preferably open the 
*doc/manual.rst*.

Install
-------

See *doc/INSTALL.md*

This document describes some tests of michi-c that you should execute before 
trying to use it. These tests will check if you get the same results on your 
computer as I got on Linux. When these tests pass, we could be fairly confident
that michi-c will work for you.
  
*Important Note*  It is highly recommended that you download Michi 
large-scale pattern files provide by Petr Baudis at

http://pachi.or.cz/michi-pat/ - unfortunately the patterns are no longer there,
please unpack patterns.7z instead. The patterns there are derived from old
Pachi patterns by some regex magic. I expect them to be weaker than missing
original patterns, but at least they exist. (Pawel Koziol)

Unpack them and place them (or a link to them) in the working directory when you run michi-c (same as michi.py), otherwise michi-c will be much weaker.
