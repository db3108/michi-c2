---------------------------------------
-- ChangeLog for the michi-c program --
---------------------------------------

1.4.2 Released May, 28 2017
- avoid avoid redondant fix_atari tests in mcplayout (small speed improvement)
- handle seki in the tree
- add a new mode : selfplay
- new tests (very simple tsumegos)
- check gtp command parameters
- sgf.c : decode a few new properties, detect if input is not a SGF file
- it is now possible to read a series of sgf files
- bugs corrections

1.4.1 Released February, 28 2016
- respect the Superko rule (Positional)
- add storesgf gtp command
- add estimated best reply in the log
- make zobrist hash initialization independant of user defined random seed
- make board a self-contained module 
- correction for reading sgf files coming from kgs
- correct a bug with noticeable impact on michi-c strength (point_env8())
- modifs to remove warnings with newer versions of gcc
- use of "long long" to insure use of 64 bits integers (hash, random generator)
- runtime check of the length of integers (runtime check for portability)
- bugs correction

1.4 Released August, 28 2015
- read simple sgf files (no variations)
- live gfx (specific for gogui)
- early passing
- specific version of random_int for 32 bits system (seems useful for windows)
- use specifed color in play and genmove commands
- preliminary (basic) version of dynamic komi
- better modularization of the code
- histogram of playout scores
- new gtp commands for visualisation of the search results with gogui 
    owner_map, principal_variation, best_moves, visit_count
- new gtp commands
    undo, final_score, final_status_list, kgs-genmove_cleanup, set_free_handicap
	gogui-setup, gogui-setup_player, gg-undo
- variable boardsize
- works with limited stack size (512 K bytes OK)
- better usage of memory
- speed improvements
- add a minimal documentation of the program structure 
- bugs corrections

1.3 Released June, 14 2015 (to play on CGOS)
- time management (sudden death only) : partial implementation of Pachi method
- option to play until the end
- move the functions dedicated to user interface in ui.c
- simplify command line interface (backward compatible)
- parameters modifiable by gtp commands
- add configuration file (gtp commands) 
- add control of verbosity
- cleanup the gtp loop
- example files to play on CGOS

1.2 Released June, 6 2015
- modifications by Horace Ho for IOS app
- removal of all calls to compute_block()
- bug correction (saturation of blocks size to 255)
- add a parameter (nsims) to michi mcdebug
- choose_random_move() stops as soon as a playable move is found
- plays about 2.5 faster in 19x19 than version 1.0 (mcplayout 3 times faster)
- add gtp commands to modify the parameters of the engine
- add gtp command to modify komi
- boardsize still fixed at compilation time

1.1 Released May, 28 2015 (Temporary version)

- functional but not fully validated nor optimized
- incremental update of blocks and liberties at each move (new board.c)
- add regression tests for board
- change color: BLACK and WHITE instead of X of x (to_play and other)
- use blocks and liberties in make_list_neighbor_blocks_in_atari()

1.0 Released May, 12 2015

- exactly the same algorithms and parameters as in michi.py
- single thread
- almost 10 times faster in 13x13 games than michi.py (with pypy and 4 threads)
- regression tests for fix_atari() and large patterns
